# Quarkus demo: Using Spring Data and JPA

## Requirements

To compile and run this demo you will need:

- JDK 1.8+
- GraalVM

In addition, you will need either a PostgreSQL database, or Docker to run one.

### Configuring GraalVM and JDK 1.8+

Make sure that both the `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables have
been set, and that a JDK 1.8+ `java` command is on the path.

See the [Building a Native Executable guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image)
for help setting up your environment.

## Building the demo

Launch the Maven build on the checked out sources of this demo:

> ./mvnw install

## Running the demo

### Prepare a PostgreSQL instance

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL instance running. To set up a PostgreSQL database with Docker:

> docker run --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 -it --rm=true --memory-swappiness=0 --name quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_USER=quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_DB=quarkus_test -p 5432:5432 postgres:11.5

Connection properties for the Agroal datasource are defined in the standard Quarkus configuration file,
`src/main/resources/application.properties`.

### Run Quarkus in developer mode

The Maven Quarkus plugin provides a development mode that supports
live coding. To try this out:

> ./mvnw quarkus:dev

This command will leave Quarkus running in the foreground listening on port 8080.

In this mode you can make changes to the code and have the changes immediately applied, by just refreshing your browser.

    Hot reload works even when modifying your JPA entities.
    Try it! Even the database schema will be updated on the fly.

### Run Quarkus in JVM mode

When you're done iterating in developer mode, you can run the application as a
conventional jar file.

First compile it:

> ./mvnw install

Then run it:

> java -jar ./target/spring-data-jpa-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar

    Have a look at how fast it boots.
    Or measure total native memory consumption...

### Run Quarkus as a native application

You can also create a native executable from this application without making any
source code changes. A native executable removes the dependency on the JVM:
everything needed to run the application on the target platform is included in
the executable, allowing the application to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compiling a native executable takes a bit longer, as GraalVM performs additional
steps to remove unnecessary codepaths. Use the  `native` profile to compile a
native executable:

> ./mvnw install -Dnative

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

> ./target/spring-data-jpa-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
