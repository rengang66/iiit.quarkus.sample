Quarkus AMQP 1.0 Quickstart
============================

This project illustrates how you can interact with AMQP 1.0 (Apache Artemis in this quickstart) using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.

## AMQP Broker

First you need an AMQP broker. You can follow the instructions from the [Apache Artemis web site](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/) or run `docker-compose up` if you have docker installed on your machine.

## Start the application

The application can be started using: 

```bash
mvn quarkus:dev
```  

Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/prices.html`, and you should see a fluctuating price.

## Anatomy

In addition to the `prices.html` page, the application is composed by 3 components:

* `PriceGenerator` - a bean generating random price. They are sent to a AMQP queue.
* `PriceConverter` - on the consuming side, the `PriceConverter` receives the AMQP message and convert the price.
The result is sent to an in-memory stream of data
* `PriceResource`  - the `PriceResource` retrieves the in-memory stream of data in which the converted prices are sent and send these prices to the browser using Server-Sent Events.

The interaction with AMQP is managed by MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.
The configuration is located in the application configuration.

NOTE: Hey, it's the same code as the Kafka quickstart! Yes, it is, the only difference is the _connector_ configured in the `application.properties`.

## Running in native

You can compile the application into a native binary using:

`mvn clean install -Pnative`

and run with:

`./target/amqp-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
